				<li id="note-1" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><dfn>Belisarius</dfn>, according to one learned guess, is a Latin transliteration of the Slavonic "Beli-Tsar," or "White Prince." Procopius elsewhere says Belisarius came from Germania, a village "on the border of Thrace and Illyria." Thus both the Germans and the Hungarians have been able to claim this general as an early hero of their race. <a href="foreword.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-2" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Silverius's later destruction, promised here, seems to have been overlooked by the impetuous historian. <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-3" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><dfn>John of Cappadocia</dfn>, pretorian prefect, was highly unpopular because of his extreme cruelties, but Justinian refused to remove him from an office he made so financially successful. Discovering he was plotting to make the Emperor distrustful of her, Theodora had Belisarius's wife, Antonina, lure John into a nocturnal assignation "to discuss a rebellion." An ambuscade of the Empress's guards nearly captured the prefect; he escaped with his life, but was permanently disgraced and became a priest. <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-4" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><dfn>Constantine</dfn>. An officer under Belisarius. <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-5" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><dfn>Presidius</dfn>, a loyal Italian, was despoiled of two jewelled daggers by Constantine, then military governor of Spoleto. Presidius complained to Belisarius. In a resulting dispute between the general and his subordinate, Constantine drew his sword against his commander. This act of mutiny resulted in his being put to death at the general's command. <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-6" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><dfn>Photius</dfn>. Son of Antonina by a former marriage. <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-7" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><dfn>Centenary</dfn>. One centenary equaled one hundred pounds of gold. <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-8" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><dfn>Chosroes</dfn>. King of Persia, sometimes called Nushirvan the Just. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-8" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-9" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><dfn>Lazica</dfn>. Country of the Lazi on the isthmus between the Euxine (Black) and the Caspian Seas; also known anciently as Colchis, the fabled land of Medea and the Golden Fleece. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-10" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><dfn>Theodosius's death</dfn>. Gibbon nicely prefers a more romantic end than the Greek allows: "Theodosius expired in the first fatigues of an amorous interview"! <a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
